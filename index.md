### Building a Cloud IaaS Infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
<p align="justify">
In the following steps I will describe the creation of a small computing infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS). On top of the infrastructure an HT Condor cluster was configured and tested to run a scientific application. The condor cluster consisted of 3 working nodes and a master node which was also configured to serve as a working node. The scientific application run was an implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train and predict secondary structure of a set of test proteins.

## 1.   Configuring the AWS instances
<p align="justify">
In total, 4 virtual machines (instances) were configured using Amazon Web Services Cloud Computing Services (https://aws.amazon.com/). The four instances corresponding to the 3 worker nodes and the master (also worker node) were of the type t2.medium (2 vCPUs, 4GB of RAM) and were configured in the same time zone to allow communication via private IP addresses, us-east-1b was chosen for being one of the cheepest regions provided by AWS. Furthermore, a shared security group was configure to allow all outbound communications and all TCP, all UDP and ICMP inbound from within the same security group and my personal computer (since some of the data was transfered from my personal computer directly to the virtual machines.
